It was the 1st of December, 2079 - the Kingfisher species were destined for extinction. The culprit? - The Three Body Problem, the universe’s most unsolvable problem.

While living a gracious life on their home planet, Kortanz, the Kingfishers knew that their time was limited. After all, their planet orbited two other celestial bodies in a manner so chaotic that it would be a miracle if they didn’t collide in the near future. But to make matters worse, one of those bodies was a star. Collision wasn’t necessary, even going near their home star would mean instant death for all life on their planet. 

The Kingfisher’s fate was hopeless - 

but then came the Cosmic Samurai.

Known as the Knight that defends our universe, the Cosmic Samurai did his best to solve the Three Body Problem - until one day, a solution appeared! Cosmic Samurai discovered the “Switch Teleport” ability, which allowed the Cosmic Samurai to displace Kortanz into another solar system and away from harm. 

The Universe thought that all matters had been resolved, but then the unthinkable happened. The Kingfisher demanded that they have access to the Switch Teleport abilities.

The Cosmic's Samurai's story was a MOONSHOT.
